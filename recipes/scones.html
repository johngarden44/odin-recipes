    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Scones are classic tea time snack, although in my house, scones are welcome any time!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/3 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>8 tablespoons unsalted frozen butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><h4>Step 1</h4><p>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C); adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position. Line a baking tray with parchment paper.</p></li>
        <li><h4>Step 2</h4><p>Mix flour, 1/3 cup sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda in a medium bowl. Grate butter into flour mixture on the large holes of a box grater. Use your fingers to work in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs, then toss in raisins.</p></li>
        <li><h4>Step 3</h4><p>Whisk sour cream and egg together in a small bowl until combined.</p></li>
        <li><h4>Step 4</h4><p>Stir sour cream mixture into flour mixture using a fork until large dough clumps form. Use your hands to shape dough into a ball. (Dough may seem dry at first but will come together as you work it.)</p></li>
        <li><h4>Step 5</h4><p>Place dough on a lightly floured surface and pat into a 7- to 8-inch circle, about 3/4-inch thick. Sprinkle with remaining 1 teaspoon of sugar. Use a sharp knife to cut into 8 equal triangles; place on the prepared baking tray, about 1-inch apart.</p></li>
        <li><h4>Step 6</h4><p>Bake scones in the preheated oven until golden, about 15 to 17 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes; serve warm or at room temperature.</p></li>
